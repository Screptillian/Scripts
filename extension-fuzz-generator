#Modified from HackTheBox Academy bash script in File Upload Attacks module
#Modified by: Screptillian
#Also works for Windows based php, can be modified to work with aspx
#Used to test for what files are allowed to be uploaded, paired with a get request using the same list OR a shortened list of what files were made can
#greatly assist in achieving code execution
